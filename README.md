Hello, my name is Oenshin. Nice to meet you!
This repository is used for collaboration between my own pad and laptop. I do most of my electronic homework with termux in my pad, but the files in termux is protected by Android which makes me unable to hand them in or to have a further edition with my laptop. To solve the problem I build this repository.
